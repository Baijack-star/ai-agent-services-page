            <p>In today's competitive market, providing excellent customer service is paramount. AI-powered chatbots are revolutionizing the way businesses interact with their customers, offering a more efficient, scalable, and personalized support experience. This tutorial will guide you through the process of building your own AI-powered customer service bot using n8n and OpenAI, two powerful tools that simplify the development process.</p>

            <h2>Why n8n and OpenAI?</h2>
            <p>n8n is a free and source-available workflow automation tool that allows you to connect different applications and services with each other without writing any code. OpenAI provides powerful language models, like GPT-4.1-mini, that can understand and generate human-like text. By combining these two platforms, you can create a sophisticated chatbot with minimal effort.</p>

            <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
            <p>Before we begin, you'll need the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>An n8n account (you can sign up for a free account on their website).</li>
                <li>An OpenAI API key.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Step 1: Setting up your n8n Workflow</h2>
            <p>The first step is to create a new workflow in n8n. A workflow is a series of connected nodes that define the logic of your chatbot. We'll start with a "Webhook" node, which will serve as the entry point for our chatbot.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Create a new workflow:</strong> Log in to your n8n account and create a new workflow.</li>
                <li><strong>Add a Webhook node:</strong> Search for the "Webhook" node and add it to your workflow. This node will generate a unique URL that you can use to send messages to your chatbot.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Step 2: Integrating with OpenAI</h2>
            <p>Now, let's connect our workflow to OpenAI to leverage its powerful language model.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Add an OpenAI node:</strong> Search for the "OpenAI" node and add it to your workflow. Connect the Webhook node to the OpenAI node.</li>
                <li><strong>Configure the OpenAI node:</strong> In the OpenAI node settings, select the "Chat" model and choose your desired model (e.g., GPT-4.1-mini). You'll also need to enter your OpenAI API key.</li>
                <li><strong>Set the prompt:</strong> The prompt is the input that you'll send to the OpenAI model. In this case, we'll use the message received from the Webhook as the prompt.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Step 3: Handling the Chatbot's Response</h2>
            <p>Once OpenAI has generated a response, we need to send it back to the user.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Add a "Respond to Webhook" node:</strong> Search for the "Respond to Webhook" node and add it to your workflow. Connect the OpenAI node to this node.</li>
                <li><strong>Configure the response:</strong> In the "Respond to Webhook" node settings, you can specify the content of the response. We'll use the response generated by the OpenAI model as the content.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Step 4: Testing your Chatbot</h2>
            <p>Now that you've set up your workflow, it's time to test your chatbot.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Activate your workflow:</strong> Click the "Activate" button to start your workflow.</li>
                <li><strong>Send a message to the Webhook URL:</strong> You can use a tool like <code>curl</code> or a web browser to send a POST request to the Webhook URL with a JSON payload containing your message.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Congratulations! You've successfully built a basic AI-powered customer service bot using n8n and OpenAI. This is just the beginning, of course. You can extend the functionality of your chatbot by adding more nodes to your workflow, such as nodes for connecting to a database, sending emails, or integrating with other services. With n8n and OpenAI, the possibilities are endless.</p>
